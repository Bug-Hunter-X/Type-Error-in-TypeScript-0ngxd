# Type Error in TypeScript
This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common type error: assigning an array of strings to a string variable. The error message 'Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string'' is displayed in the console.
The solution involves changing the type of the variable to accept arrays or modifying the function to handle arrays of strings appropriately.
